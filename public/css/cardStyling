Things to do:
-Working on sidebar partial




Adding sidebar steps
- Define the route.  
router.get("/feed/:sport", ensureAuth, postsController.getSportFeed);
((the : allows dynamic filling of the paramater from url))

- Create controller function
    - Get sport from url (req.params.sport)
    - Format sport to match DB
    - Query DB for formattedSport
    - Render only the requested sport posts.
    - WORKING LETS GOOOOOOO

- Getting it to look nice.
    - Wrap sidebar and wrapper html together since they are going to sit side by side.
