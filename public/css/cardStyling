Things to do:
-Working on sidebar partial




Adding sidebar steps
- Define the route.  
router.get("/feed/:sport", ensureAuth, postsController.getSportFeed);
((the : allows dynamic filling of the paramater from url))

- Create controller function
    - Get sport from url (req.params.sport)
    - Format sport to match DB
    - Query DB for formattedSport
    - Render only the requested sport posts.
    - WORKING LETS GOOOOOOO

- Getting it to look nice.
    - Wrap sidebar and wrapper html together since they are going to sit side by side.
    
CURRENTLY FINISHED WITH SIDEBAR AND FEED LAYOUT\

- Working on comment functionality and display on postTest.ejs
Styling and content are set for the individual posts.  Working on getting comment functionality working.  Comments not saving to DB the way I have the model so check comments controller
-Comments model complete and saving to db.  
COMMENT SECTION WORKING AS INTENDED
- Comments weren't showing because I wasn't referencing the postID only the post.
---- const comments = await Comment.find({post: req.params.id}) would return no results because it is looking at the wrong field.  The field was called postID.


----PROFILE PAGE and utility function for date formatting
- Profile page setup to display the users bets.


old..UP NEXT: Utility function for date formatting.  Record tracking
- Add pagination to profile page to only pull up the most recent bets to not overload the system when the database gets larger over time.
-Record tracking: Allow an admin to have a thumb up and down when viewing bets for easy tracking.  Look into the deletion icon function and remix it?
- Figure out how to view a user's bets via a profile page of the user. Maybe copy  profile page, remove form, and populate using createdBy again?


COMPLETED: Viewing another user's profile.  Must compare the id with .toString for the comparison to work.  Has logic to redirect to profile or viewUserProfile page depending on the user chosen.
UP NEXT: 
On profile page, when clicking on a post, it gets an error.  Fix that.
